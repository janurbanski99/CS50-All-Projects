Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
the smaller "N" the less accurate prediction (i.e. in particular 10 and 100)

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
100000
